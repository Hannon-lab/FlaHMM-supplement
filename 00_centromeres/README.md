```
ln -s ../data data
```


`Centromere_definition.ipynb` contains a Jupyter notebook describing the annotation of centromeric regions. The resulting coordinates are saved as `centromere_coordinates.txt` and some of them are shown in Figure S1.

The `bins/bins_100k` directory contains transposon content across 100 kb windows. Instructions for construction this are available here: https://github.com/susbo/Drosophila_unistrand_clusters/tree/main/De-novo_clusters
